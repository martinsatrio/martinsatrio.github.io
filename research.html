      <h1>Postdoctoral Research Associate</h1>
      <h2><em>CIWRO / University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK</em></h2>
      <p class="lead">As a Post-Doctoral Research Associate at <a href="https://www.ou.edu/ciwro">CIWRO</a>, my main focus was on continuing 
        our understanding of supercell thunderstorms and the conditions attendant to tornadogenesis through observational methods. 
        Specifically, I was tasked with looking through the wealth of observational data that were collected during the 2019 and 2022 field phases of the 
        Targeted Observation by Radars and UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) of Supercells (TORUS) project. Using the two deployed airborne radars 
        mounted onto P3 aircraft, the ground-based NOXP mobile radar, and nearby operational (WSR-88D) radars, we aimed to analyze individual case studies 
        through four-dimensional Doppler wind syntheses and diabatic Lagrangian analyses, following the work I did in my PhD career. By the end, we attained 
        a longitudinal analyses of the cataloged cases in terms of updraft characterizations to improve our conceptual understanding of supercells, 
        with the ultimate goal of improving model guidance.
      </p>
      <p> I was also involved in the Low-Level Internal Flows in Tornadoes Experiment (LIFT) field campaign that aimed to obtain novel observations of near-surface 
        tornado flows through a suite of in-situ and remote sensing instrumentation. I assisted in the deployment and operation of mobile radars, 
        mobile mesonets, and other instrumentation to capture high-resolution observations of tornadoes. This campaign was a collaborative effort between CIWRO, 
        the University of Oklahoma, and Texas Tech University. My main role was with the LiDAR team, where we successfully scanned several tornadoes during the 
        2025 field season, a feat that had not been accomplished previously.
