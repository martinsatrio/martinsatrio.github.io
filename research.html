      <h1>Postdoctoral Research Associate</h1>
      <h2><em>CIWRO / University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK</em></h2>
      <p class="lead">As a Post-Doctoral Research Associate at <a href="https://www.ou.edu/ciwro">CIWRO</a>, my main focus was on continuing 
        our understanding of supercell thunderstorms and the conditions attendant to tornadogenesis through observational methods. 
        Specifically, I was tasked with looking through the wealth of observational data that were collected during the 2019 and 2022 field phases of the 
        Targeted Observation by Radars and UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) of Supercells (TORUS) project. Using the two deployed airborne radars 
        mounted onto P3 aircraft, the ground-based NOXP mobile radar, and nearby operational (WSR-88D) radars, we aimed to analyze individual case studies 
        through four-dimensional Doppler wind syntheses and diabatic Lagrangian analyses, following the work I did in my PhD career. By the end, we attained 
        a longitudinal analyses of the cataloged cases in terms of updraft characterizations to improve our conceptual understanding of supercells, 
        with the ultimate goal of improving model guidance.
      </p>
      <p class="lead"> I was also involved in the Low-Level Internal Flows in Tornadoes Experiment (LIFT) field campaign that aimed to obtain novel observations of near-surface 
        tornado flows through a suite of in-situ and remote sensing instrumentation. I assisted in the deployment and operation of mobile radars, 
        mobile mesonets, and other instrumentation to capture high-resolution observations of tornadoes. This campaign was a collaborative effort between CIWRO, 
        the University of Oklahoma, and Texas Tech University. My main role was with the LiDAR team, where we successfully scanned several tornadoes during the 
        2025 field season, a feat that had not been accomplished previously.

      <p><a href="https://shareok.org/handle/11244/338761">Dissertation</a> Title: A Kinematic and Thermodynamic Analysis of the 17 May 2019 McCook / Farnam, Nebraska Tornadic Supercell</p>
      <p>Abstract</p>
      <p class="lead"><em>The Targeted Observation by Radars and UAS of Supercells field project successfully deployed on a cyclic tornadic 
        supercell in southwest Nebraska on 17 May 2019. This case study uses data from the two airborne radars mounted onto the P3 along with
        the ground-based NOXP radar for a triple-Doppler wind synthesis from 22:57 UTC to 00:36 UTC. Wind synthesis and gridded reflectivity
        are ingested into a diabatic Lagrangian algorithm (DLA) to obtain gridded thermodynamic information including θ, θv, and various mixing ratios.</em>
      </p>
      <p class="lead"><em>Low-level analyses in Chapter 2 show that the triple-Doppler winds capture general supercell behavior, including a transition from 
        a weaker to stronger low-level mesocyclone (LLM) as the supercell becomes more actively tornadic, especially after 00:00UTC. Vortex-line arches (VLAs) 
        are shown to be associated with the first EF-2 tornado, but weak low-level updrafts likely resulted in the short-lived nature of the first tornado. 
        After a clear reorganization period from 23:06 to 00:00 UTC, clear strengthening of the near-surface circulation is coincident with northerly reorientation 
        of the winds within the RFD. LLM strengthening is also coincident with a shift of LLM parcels originating from the forward-flank precipitation region rather 
        than directly from the undisturbed inflow environment, matching well with numerical simulation results showing forward-flank parcels play a large role in LLM 
        modulation. ζ stretching within the 0–1 km layer is relatively weak until 00:15 UTC, evidenced by two significant but short-lived (3 and 4 min) tornadoes. 
        After 00:15 UTC, however, collocation of 0–1 km updrafts with ζ centered on and to the northwest of the circulation show consistent stretching, which likely 
        contributed to a longer-lived, 18 min EF-1 tornado after 00:15 UTC. Isosurfaces of ζ show a deep, continuous mesocyclone at this time with the 0.05 s-1 isosurface 
        connected from the ground to 9 km prior to occlusion at 00:30 UTC.</em></p>
      <p class="lead"><em>Evolution of surface baroclinic boundaries from the DLA in Chapter 3 reveal key changes as the supercell strengthens around 00:00 UTC — 
        namely, a cold pool surge within the forward-flank region simultaneous with a surface warm pocket appearance at 23:48 UTC that leads to rear-flank downdraft 
        maturation just before a significant tornado. Vorticity budgets along parcels terminating within the LLM at 00:00 UTC show clear evidence of baroclinic 
        generation of streamwise horizontal vorticity along θv gradients. While observed SVCs have been noted in previous literature via cross-sectional or RHI analyses, 
        this study is the first to explicitly compute vorticity budgets along parcel trajectories within a long-lived tornadic supercell, providing evidence that SVCs 
        in numerical simulations are indeed physical.</em>
      </p>
      <p class="lead">Outside of my doctoral research, I collaborated on a formally published group project on the climatology of cell mergers and their effects on 
        supercell evolution using WSR-88D and MRMS data. I collaborated on another project comparing observed tree fall from the 10 December 2021 Mayfield, KY tornado 
        with a large-eddy vortex traversing similar terrain (currently in-review). Lastly, I was involved in multiple field projects through my PhD career including 
        PERiLS 2022 & 2023 as well as TORUS 2022 & TORUS-LItE 2023. During those field campaigns, I was apart of several missions, including NSSL Mobile Mesonets, 
        windsondes, and LiDAR.
