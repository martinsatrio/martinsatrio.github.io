      <h1>Postdoctoral Research Associate</h1>
      <h2><em>CIWRO / University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK</em></h2>
      <p class="lead">As a Post-Doctoral Research Associate at <a href="https://www.ou.edu/ciwro">CIWRO</a>, my main focus was on continuing 
        our understanding of supercell thunderstorms and the conditions attendant to tornadogenesis through observational methods. 
        Specifically, I was tasked with looking through the wealth of observational data that were collected during the 2019 and 2022 field phases of the 
        Targeted Observation by Radars and UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) of Supercells (TORUS) project. Using the two deployed airborne radars 
        mounted onto P3 aircraft, the ground-based NOXP mobile radar, and nearby operational (WSR-88D) radars, we aimed to analyze individual case studies 
        through four-dimensional Doppler wind syntheses and diabatic Lagrangian analyses, following the work I did in my PhD career. By the end, we attained 
        a longitudinal analyses of the cataloged cases in terms of updraft characterizations to improve our conceptual understanding of supercells, 
        with the ultimate goal of improving model guidance.
      </p><br>
      <p class="lead"> I was also involved in the Low-Level Internal Flows in Tornadoes Experiment (LIFT) field campaign that aimed to obtain novel observations of near-surface 
        tornado flows through a suite of in-situ and remote sensing instrumentation. I assisted in the deployment and operation of mobile radars, 
        mobile mesonets, and other instrumentation to capture high-resolution observations of tornadoes. This campaign was a collaborative effort between CIWRO, 
        the University of Oklahoma, and Texas Tech University. My main role was with the LiDAR team, where we successfully scanned several tornadoes during the 
        2025 field season, a feat that had not been accomplished previously.

      <h1>Ph.D. Research</h1>
      <h2><em>CIWRO / University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK</em></h2>
      <p><a href="https://shareok.org/handle/11244/338761">Dissertation</a> Title: A Kinematic and Thermodynamic Analysis of the 17 May 2019 McCook / Farnam, Nebraska Tornadic Supercell</p>
      <p>Abstract</p>
      <p class="lead"><em>The Targeted Observation by Radars and UAS of Supercells field project successfully deployed on a cyclic tornadic 
        supercell in southwest Nebraska on 17 May 2019. This case study uses data from the two airborne radars mounted onto the P3 along with
        the ground-based NOXP radar for a triple-Doppler wind synthesis from 22:57 UTC to 00:36 UTC. Wind synthesis and gridded reflectivity
        are ingested into a diabatic Lagrangian algorithm (DLA) to obtain gridded thermodynamic information including θ, θv, and various mixing ratios.</em>
      </p><br>
      <p class="lead"><em>Low-level analyses in Chapter 2 show that the triple-Doppler winds capture general supercell behavior, including a transition from 
        a weaker to stronger low-level mesocyclone (LLM) as the supercell becomes more actively tornadic, especially after 00:00UTC. Vortex-line arches (VLAs) 
        are shown to be associated with the first EF-2 tornado, but weak low-level updrafts likely resulted in the short-lived nature of the first tornado. 
        After a clear reorganization period from 23:06 to 00:00 UTC, clear strengthening of the near-surface circulation is coincident with northerly reorientation 
        of the winds within the RFD. LLM strengthening is also coincident with a shift of LLM parcels originating from the forward-flank precipitation region rather 
        than directly from the undisturbed inflow environment, matching well with numerical simulation results showing forward-flank parcels play a large role in LLM 
        modulation. ζ stretching within the 0–1 km layer is relatively weak until 00:15 UTC, evidenced by two significant but short-lived (3 and 4 min) tornadoes. 
        After 00:15 UTC, however, collocation of 0–1 km updrafts with ζ centered on and to the northwest of the circulation show consistent stretching, which likely 
        contributed to a longer-lived, 18 min EF-1 tornado after 00:15 UTC. Isosurfaces of ζ show a deep, continuous mesocyclone at this time with the 0.05 s-1 isosurface 
        connected from the ground to 9 km prior to occlusion at 00:30 UTC.</em>
      </p><br>
      <p class="lead"><em>Evolution of surface baroclinic boundaries from the DLA in Chapter 3 reveal key changes as the supercell strengthens around 00:00 UTC — 
        namely, a cold pool surge within the forward-flank region simultaneous with a surface warm pocket appearance at 23:48 UTC that leads to rear-flank downdraft 
        maturation just before a significant tornado. Vorticity budgets along parcels terminating within the LLM at 00:00 UTC show clear evidence of baroclinic 
        generation of streamwise horizontal vorticity along θv gradients. While observed SVCs have been noted in previous literature via cross-sectional or RHI analyses, 
        this study is the first to explicitly compute vorticity budgets along parcel trajectories within a long-lived tornadic supercell, providing evidence that SVCs 
        in numerical simulations are indeed physical.</em>
      </p><br>
      <p class="lead">Outside of my doctoral research, I collaborated on a formally published group project on the climatology of cell mergers and their effects on 
        supercell evolution using WSR-88D and MRMS data. I collaborated on another project comparing observed tree fall from the 10 December 2021 Mayfield, KY tornado 
        with a large-eddy vortex traversing similar terrain (currently in-review). Lastly, I was involved in multiple field projects through my PhD career including 
        PERiLS 2022 & 2023 as well as TORUS 2022 & TORUS-LItE 2023. During those field campaigns, I was apart of several missions, including NSSL Mobile Mesonets, 
        windsondes, and LiDAR.

      <h1>Ph.D. General Exam</h1>
      <h2><em>CIWRO / University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK</em></h2>
      <p><strong>Topic:</strong> A Proposed Observation Network to Investigate Deep Convection Initiation and Early Evolution of Supercells in the Great Plains and Southeast</p>
      <p class="lead"><strong>Background:</strong> While there is a general understanding of environmental characteristic that lead to favorable supercell production (strong wind shear, 
        large instability, etc.), it is often the case that, even on days with favorable parameters, only a very small percentage of cells that initiate will become tornadic. 
        Only on the most rare of days (3 May 1999) will a substantial fraction of the cells mature to become tornadic. One area that requires closer scrutiny is the role of 
        convection initiation and the cell's early evolution; namely, are there observable characteristics through the cell's initiation and early growth that may yield key 
        information about that cell's tendency towards organization and its eventual likelihood of tornadogenesis? My goal in the general exam was to 1) develop a set of testable 
        hypotheses that can be observationally investigated which relates environmental influences on cell evolution and how this may affect the probability of eventual tornadogenesis 
        and 2) to design a hypothetical observing network (fixed or mobile) that would be capable of testing such hypothesis.
      </p><br>
      <p class="lead"><strong>Abstract:</strong> While previous studies documenting the mature stages of a supercell and dynamic processes related to tornadic potential and 
        tornadogenesis are plentiful, earlier processes in the cell’s life cycle merit closer scrutiny. Namely, the storm processes during the period of deep convection initiation 
        (DCI) to initial supercell organization may yield key indications on the future severity of the cell. While there are numerous studies specifically focusing on DCI, 
        including environmental factors that influence DCI behaviors, studies focusing on a cell’s early morphology towards organization are rare, and those relating DCI to 
        future organization potential are even more scarce. A set of testable hypotheses relating to DCI and early cell morphology are posed that have yet to be sufficiently 
        answered. Then, a proposed fixed observation network to monitor DCI and early morphology of cells both in the Great Plains and the Southeast, named DCINet, is introduced. 
        DCINet will utilize existing observational networks including satellite data but will also consist of three new key components: 1) gap-filling, volumetric-scanning, 
        polarimetric C-band radars, 2) autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles that will sample vertical profiles of temperature and humidity in the boundary layer and lower-cloud 
        environment, and 3) surface weather stations that will be located in tandem with vertical profilers. The goal of observational data collected with DCINet is to 
        satisfactorily answer the set of testable hypotheses.
      </p><br>
      <p class="lead"><strong>Hypotheses:</strong>
        <br>1. The density of DCI is modulated by environmental instability and the forcing mechanism, i.e., higher-CAPE, lower-CIN, and strongly forced environments will yield a higher density of DCI cells.
        <br>2. A majority of the cells that undergo DCI do not end up becoming organized but rather dissipate or become mergers.
        <br>3. The percentage of cells that undergo DCI but dissipate before becoming mature is scaled to environmental factors, e.g., drier midlevels correlate to a higher rate of cell dissipation.
        <br>4. Within the same synoptic environment, there are measurable differences between cells that dissipate after DCI and those that become mature supercells / tornadic (e.g., DCI cells with stronger initial updrafts are more likely to organize and become mature).
        <br>5. Cells that undergo DCI earlier in an event have a higher likelihood of becoming mature / tornadic and are longer-lived than those that initiate later.
        <br>6. Cells which have other DCI cells in close proximity are less likely to dissipate than those that undergo DCI in isolation. Additionally, mature supercells that have DCI in close proximity leading to cell mergers are more likely to become tornadic.
