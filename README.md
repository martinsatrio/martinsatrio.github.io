# SoftLight Site

A clean, modern, multi‑page personal website with a light theme and soft colors.

## How to use

1. Replace text like "Your Name" and example content across pages.
2. Put your CV at `assets/cv/CV.pdf` (update the button text if you like).
3. Update the email in `contact.html` (search for `mailto:you@example.com`).
4. Optional: Replace `assets/img/favicon.svg` with your own favicon/logo.
5. Deploy by uploading the folder to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).
